Nanopuller is an open software designed for control and data acquisition of Atomic Force Microscope based force
spectroscopy experiment. The software allows relatively easy creation of setup, suitable both for single molecule
pulling and nanoindentation, using only easily available equipment and at a fraction of cost of a commercial
instrument. The software allows manual or automatic force curve acquisition and it has lot of features that make the
Nanopuller particularly suited for force spectroscopy experiments. Software is written using National Instruments
LabView 2013, allowing easy customization even for researchers with no prior experience in programming. However,
Nanopuller does not require installing the full commertial LabView environment locally. As a compiled installer
is also available, the program is ready to use straight after installation with only minor adjustments. A compiled
program includes both LabView runtime engine and all up-to date NI device drivers (NI-DAQmx 9.8). List of
supported DAQ devices can be found on NI website.
